<h1>Come Home</h1>
<h2>BAYNK</h2>

<h3>[Verse 1]</h3>
The world is burning
Just come home
I can feel my body turning
Come home
Even though the world is burning
Just come home
I can feel my body turning

<h3>[Pre-Chorus]</h3>
You want my love
You want my love

<h3>[Chorus]</h3>
I could never say, "This feels right"
That's okay, this talk goes all night
How can we see the light if we're both blinded?
You want my love, there's only love for you

<h3>[Verse 2]</h3>
You feel uncertain
Just come home
Run away from all your curses
Come home
Even if you feel uncertain
Just come home
Run away from all your curses

<h3>[Pre-Chorus]</h3>
You want my love
You want my love

<h3>[Chorus]</h3>
I could never say, "This feels right"
That's okay, this talk goes all night
How can we see the light if we're both blinded?
You want my love, there's only love for you

<h3>[Bridge]</h3>
And you're not all wrong
You're all I see
When the lights go down
That's all I is
But you're not all wrong
You're all I see
When the lights go down
That's all I is
And you're not all wrong
You're all I see
When the lights go down
That's all I is

<h3>[Outro]</h3>
Lights go down
That's all I is
When the lights go down
That's all I is
