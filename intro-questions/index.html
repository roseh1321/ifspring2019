        <h1>a little bit about me</h1>
        <ol>
            <li><h2>Provide your name, major, year in school (sophomore, junior, etc).</h2> Hi! My name is Rose and I'm a sophomore studying psychology with minors in marketing and design.</li>
            <li><h2>Tell me a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class.</h2>
            I have a background in video/motion graphics and I am taking this class to learn more about coding/design and build my portfolio. I think the fields of ux and interaction design are so exciting and i would love to learn more.</li>
            <li><h2>Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell me a bit about it.</h2>
            I have done an online course in html/css and i am currently taking web development in the engineering school. I also took an introductory javascript course in highschool.</li>
            <li><h2>Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.</h2>
            I hope to learn how to make a website that is both aesthetically beautiful and functional. I also hope to learn how to be more organized and efficient when coding.</li>
            <li><h2>Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.</h2>
            One thing that I anticipate to be different is all the different considerations you have to take into account when designing for the screen. Different browsers, font availability, screen size, accessibility etc. I think making websites both accessible and responsive will be my biggest challenge.</li>
