  <li> The done button makes the titles stack on top of each other. Are they supposed to go away/disappear?</li>
  <li> For each individual instruction, maybe instead of paragraph form, make bullets or a list of shortened
        instructions. It's easier to follow one instruction and go on to the next. I find myself re-reading the
        paragraph to find where I left off.
  </li>
  <li> I know you're trying to match the color scheme with the tiramisu, but maybe choose some better colors?
        I personally don't really like the brown color scheme, but could just be me.(: I really liked the sectioning
        idea that you have.

    The sticky stack is great, but it blocks the screen as user proceeds to the later steps.
     After Mascarpone section, it is very hard to read from the screen.
      So keeping one sticky stack at a time would be a good way to keep the cool stack effect and give users some room to read.
    on clicking Done button, removing the current and any previous stacks instead of simply collapsing stack may be another way to implement this feature.

      But in general, the color schemes really match the color of Tiramisu, and I like how stacks stack like Tiramisu

        Also dividing each steps in a smaller steps (maybe numbered?) would let users to follow the recipe more easily.
