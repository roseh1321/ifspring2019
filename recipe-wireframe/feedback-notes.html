  <li>Nice categorization</li>
  <li>Adding some pictures for some of the steps with lots of blank spaces could be helpful.</li>
      <ul>

            for example, it might be helpful to show what cream peak looks like ?
          </li>
      </ul>
  <li>Overall I like how you listed all the ingredients and tools needed. Also because each step has whole page, users would be able to focus on each step more thoroughly.</li>
