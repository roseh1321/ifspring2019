<h1>Come Home</h1>
<h2>BAYNK</h2>

<h3>[Verse 1]</h3>
The world is burning<br>
Just come home<br>
I can feel my body turning<br>
Come home<br>
Even though the world is burning<br>
Just come home<br>
I can feel my body turning


<h3>[Pre-Chorus]</h3>
You want my love<br>
You want my love


<h3>[Chorus]</h3>
<div class="chorus">
I could never say, "This feels right"<br>
That's okay, this talk goes all night<br>
How can we see the light if we're both blinded?<br>
You want my love, there's only love for you
</div>

<h3>[Verse 2]</h3>
You feel uncertain<br>
Just come home<br>
Run away from all your curses<br>
Come home<br>
Even if you feel uncertain<br>
Just come home<br>
Run away from all your curses

<h3>[Pre-Chorus]</h3>
You want my love<br>
You want my love

<h3>[Chorus]</h3>
<div class="chorus">
I could never say, "This feels right"<br>
That's okay, this talk goes all night<br>
How can we see the light if we're both blinded?<br>
You want my love, there's only love for you
</div>

<h3>[Bridge]</h3>
And you're not all wrong<br>
You're all I see<br>
When the lights go down<br>
That's all I is<br>
But you're not all wrong<br>
You're all I see<br>
When the lights go down<br>
That's all I is<br>
And you're not all wrong<br>
You're all I see<br>
When the lights go down<br>
That's all I is

<h3>[Outro]</h3>
Lights go down<br>
That's all I is<br>
When the lights go down<br>
That's all I is
